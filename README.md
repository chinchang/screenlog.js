=====
*Bring console.log, on the screen*
***

Ever faced a situation where you said "Why doesn't this bug show up when developer console is open!!"? And since the bug doesn't show when you have console open, you cannot do debug logging using `console.log`.

Enter `screenlog.js`. `screenlog.js` brings the developer console right on your screen so that you can do logging without having the developer console open always.

### [Example](https://github.com/chinchang/screenlog.js/blob/master/example.html)

Usage
-----

Do `npm install screenlog` or `bower install screenlog` or [download the project](https://github.com/chinchang/screenlog.js/archive/master.zip).

Drop `dist/screenlog.min.js` into your web application and initialize it with:

```js
screenLog.init();
```

And you are done!
**By default, every next `console.log` in your app now starts logging on the screen too in addition to the console. Or you can use screenLog.log() instead to just log on the screen.**


Public API
-----

### screenLog.init([options])

Intializes the screen logger. It creates a customizable panel on the screen.

* `options` - A map of additional options.
	* `color` - Text color. Default is `lightgreen`.
	* `bgColor` - Background color of the log panel. Default is `black`.
	* `freeConsole` - By default console.log is overridden to log on screen. You can avoid this behaviour by setting `freeConsole` to `true` and instead use `screenLog.log()` api. Default is `false`.

### screenLog.log(obj1 [, obj2, ..., objN])

Logs a message on the screen.

* `obj1 ... objN` - A list of JavaScript objects or strings to output. Just like `console.log`.

### screenLog.clear()

Clears messages on the screen.

### screenLog.destroy()

Removes the logger from the UI and reverts to original console functionality.
